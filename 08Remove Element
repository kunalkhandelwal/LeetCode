    #Use while loop whenever you are iterating in an array whose length is changing!
    #Use for loop for automatic iteration of the array. Where the length of the array is always constant and you      are not deleting or adding any other element
    
    #Merged sorted array for linked list
    #python sorting - NlogN, it is an internal sort about which we are not sure of, it sorts in the best possible way.
    # For while loop, always start with i=0 first!!! Because the system must know where to start from.
